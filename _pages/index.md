I am a consultant Software Engineer at [Detillens](https://www.detillens.com/) working exclusively at [Morgan Stanley](https://www.morganstanley.com/). 

I have previously worked at [Vodafone](https://www.vodafone.co.uk/), [Adimo](https://adimo.co), [Unviersity of St Andrews School of Computer Science](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/computer-science/) and [Emax Systems](https://www.emax-systems.co.uk/).

My native language is English but I am fluent in Chinese Mandarin. Programmatically speaking, I am proficient with C, C#, Java and Python.

In my spare time I enjoy reading articles about global politics, consumer technology trends, playing golf at East Kilbride Golf Club and playing video games such as Valorant and Beat Saber.
