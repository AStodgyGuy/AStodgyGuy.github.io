I am a recent graduate from the University of St Andrews receiving a First Class Honours in Computer Science. 

From September onwards, I will be working at [Vodafone](https://www.vodafone.co.uk/) as a 
graduate software engineer. 

I have previously worked at [Adimo](https://adimo.co), [Unviersity of St Andrews School of Computer Science](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/computer-science/) and [Emax Systems](https://www.emax-systems.co.uk/).

My native language is English but I am fluent in Chinese Mandarin. Programmatically speaking, I am proficient with C, C#, Java and Python.

In my spare time I enjoy reading articles about global politics, consumer technology trends and playing video games such as Counter Stirke: Global Offensive, Valorant and Beat Saber.
