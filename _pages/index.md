I am a final year undergraduate student studying computer science at the University of St Andrews.

I am currently an intern at [Adimo](https://adimo.co).

At university I am the president and club captain of the University of St Andrews Table Tennis Club. I have previously captained the East Kilbride Table Tennis Club and represented the West of Scotland in district competitions.

My native language is English but I am fluent in Chinese Mandarin. Programmatically speaking, I am proficient with C, C#, Java and Python.

In my spare time I enjoy reading articles about global politics, international relations policy as well as consumer technology trends.
