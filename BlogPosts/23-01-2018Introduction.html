                    Hello! Welcome to my personal blog. I am committed to writing up one blog post every two weeks. In my blog posts I'll be blogging about the things that have happened or interested me 
                    in the past two weeks. Since this is the very first post, I'm going to cheat and talk about things that have happened in the past month rather than the past two weeks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First off, over christmas my family and I got a dog. Here she is, meet Mindy - a cross between a Shih-Tzu and Chihuahua.

                    When we first got Mindy from her previous owner, we were told that she doesn't bark and for a good couple of weeks she didn't bark at all. All that came out of her
                    cute little mouth were groans, grunts and moans. That all changed when my friends came over to my house to play some <a href="https://jackboxgames.com/project/drawful2/">Drawful</a>.
                    The minute she saw my friends she started barking and oh my, she is an agreesive barker. She kept barking until my friends got out of her sight, it doesn't look like it but Mindy
                    would definitely make a great guard-dog.
                </p>

                    Moving on from the cute dog, I am a big fan of board games and recently a friend of mine purchased a game called <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic">Pandemic</a> and invited
                    me and some of my other friends to play. To summarise the game, there are four diseases that have infected cities around the world represented on the game board. Each player assumes the role of a 
                    disease-fighting specialist whose mission is the cure all four diseases.

                        </div>

                    What I love about this game, is that it's not your average game where you're trying to beat the other players. Pandemic is all about working together as a team to devise a strategy to
                    cure the four diseases. This means that there is loads of discussion amongst the players on what to do next and since everyone has different ideas, it is a great game to improve your communication
                    skills as well as testing your reasoning ability.
                </p>

                    By no means is this game easy. I haven't mentioned a critical game mechanism called "Epidemics" aswell as outbreaks. I won't go into detail in this blog post, but let's just say that there are more
                    ways to lose this game than there are to win this game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course the aim of the game is to win but losing is fun as well. I have, so far, played 10 games of Pandemic and 7 of those were losses. However, after each loss I think to myself; "what if I did this
                    instead of that" or "next time I'm going to try [insert strategy here]". And for me, thinking about these things after the game is fun because it challenges my brain to think of new and creative strategies that 
                    I can try for next time.
                </p>

                    That about wraps it up for this blog, thank you for taking the time to read this post. If all goes to plan, expect another blog post in two weeks.
