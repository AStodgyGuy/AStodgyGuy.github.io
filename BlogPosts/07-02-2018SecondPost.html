                    The last two weeks have just flown by. University work has been slowly piling on but I've managed to find time doing things
                    I enjoy. Over the past two weeks I've been exploring the wonders of machine learning and playing table tennis matches for the university
                    and for my team in Dundee League.

                <p style="clear:left">
                    I've been learning about how machine learning works, why its so promising and how to actually code a simple binary classifier. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've been binging on YouTube videos learning about the machine learning process and I came across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi">this</a> series by
                    3Blue1Brown. It provides a great visual insight into how neural networks work and how the machine 'learns' based on data. For the people reading this
                    blog who don't know what neural networks are, neural networks form the basis of all machine learning work. Basically machines can learn by analysing data
                    and finding patterns within that data to either classify what kind of data it is or to predict the next value when given a sequence of data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've been working on building a simple binary classifier which classifies cats and dogs. You can download the code and run the code that I ran <a href="https://gist.github.com/AStodgyGuy/7fac1fd6f1510c3a8897937ec6c04995">here.</a>       
                    I trained this code network with over 1000 images of cats and dogs and it returned an accuracy rate of just over 75%. Not bad for a first attempt at a neural network. I plan
                    to continue my journey in neural networks and expand my network to recognise more than cats and dogs. Hopefully in the next two weeks I'll be able to 
                    update this blog with a multi-class classifier rather than a binary one. One day I hope to build an AI that can learn to play any board game given the rules of the game. In the last
                    blog post I mentioned Pandemic which is quite a complex game as it requires communication between players and players to work together. This idea of AI talking to each other
                    is not an original idea, it's an idea that has been theorised and put into practice by Google Engineer Geoffrey Hinton. He theorised a concept called 'thought vectors' which is basically
                    a vector with information that represents thought. With this vector we can pass it to other AIs which can interpret and understand this vector then use this vector for its calculations.
                    This is greatly beneficial for an AI built to play Pandemic as each AI represents a character in the game i.e. a medic, engineer etc and conveying that character's thoughts to other characters
                    (other AI) will help AIs win Pandemic.

                    When I'm not coding or playing board games I'm either eating or playing sport. One of my favourite sports to play is Table Tennis. I have been playing
                    table tennis for around 8 years now and played competitively in Scotland for 4 years. At my best, I was ranked 5th for under 18 boys and was ranked
                    best junior player in the West of Scotland district. Now at university I represent my university at the British University and Colleges Sport (BUCS) Table Tennis league
                    and I also play in the Dundee District Table Tennis Association (DDTA) League for the team Prefects.

                    For those interested in my play style I play with long pimples specifically Andro Chaos with a 1mm sponge on my backhand and Tibhar's Aurus Select for my 
                    forehand. I like to use my pimples to try and cause <i>chaos</i> for my opponent and when the ball does come to my forehand I like to play heavy top-spin
                    into my opponents body or into the corners.
                </p>

                    Over the last two weeks I've played one BUCS match and three DDTA league matches. For the BUCS match we played Edinburgh University and University of Strathcyle's second 
                    team. We lost to Edinburgh 9-5 and beat Strathcyle 9-0. Edinburgh have a really strong team and are favourites to win the competition, their players are quick, powerful and 
                    technically very gifted. Their star player is by far a German undergrad student Johannes who has been training with the Scottish mens number 2 and artifically has a rating
                    of 8th best man in Scotland. As for Stratchylde's seconds, they played well but we are definitely the better side, the result doesn't really reflect the quality of their side.
                    As for DDTA league matches, my winning rate has been slowly increasing but the competition is tough. A lot of the players are able to deal with my long pimples but very few are able to
                    deal with my heavy top-spin. Over the last two weeks, I have been refining my forehand top-spin technique so that I am more accurate and more deadly with my forehand top-spin. Hopefully over
                    the next two weeks the training will pay off and my win-rate continues to climb.
